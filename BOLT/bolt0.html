<h2>The Spark: A Short Introduction to Lightning</h2>

<p>Lightning is a protocol for making fast payments with Bitcoin using a
network of channels.</p>

<h3>Channels</h3>

<p>Lightning works by establishing <em>channels</em>: two participants create a
Lightning payment channel that contains some amount of bitcoin (e.g.,
0.1 bitcoin) that they've locked up on the Bitcoin network. It is
spendable only with both their signatures.</p>

<p>Initially they each hold a bitcoin transaction that sends all the
bitcoin (e.g. 0.1 bitcoin) back to one party.  They can later sign a new bitcoin
transaction that splits these funds differently, e.g. 0.09 bitcoin to one
party, 0.01 bitcoin to the other, and invalidate the previous bitcoin
transaction so it won't be spent.</p>

<p>See <a href="02-peer-protocol.md#channel-establishment">BOLT #2: Channel Establishment</a> for more on
channel establishment and <a href="03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output">BOLT #3: Funding Transaction Output</a> for the format of the bitcoin transaction that creates the channel.  See <a href="05-onchain.md">BOLT #5: Recommendations for On-chain Transaction Handling</a> for the requirements when participants disagree or fail, and the cross-signed bitcoin transaction must be spent.</p>

<h3>Conditional Payments</h3>

<p>A Lightning channel only allows payment between two participants, but channels can be connected together to form a network that allows payments between all members of the network. This requires the technology of a conditional payment, which can be added to a channel,
e.g. "you get 0.01 bitcoin if you reveal the secret within 6 hours".
Once the recipient presents the secret, that bitcoin transaction is
replaced with one lacking the conditional payment and adding the funds
to that recipient's output.</p>

<p>See <a href="02-peer-protocol.md#adding-an-htlc-update_add_htlc">BOLT #2: Adding an HTLC</a> for the commands a participant uses to add a conditional payment, and <a href="03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction">BOLT #3: Commitment Transaction</a> for the
complete format of the bitcoin transaction.</p>

<h3>Forwarding</h3>

<p>Such a conditional payment can be safely forwarded to another
participant with a lower time limit, e.g. "you get 0.01 bitcoin if you reveal the secret
within 5 hours".  This allows channels to be chained into a network
without trusting the intermediaries.</p>

<p>See <a href="02-peer-protocol.md#forwarding-htlcs">BOLT #2: Forwarding HTLCs</a> for details on forwarding payments, <a href="04-onion-routing.md#packet-structure">BOLT #4: Packet Structure</a> for how payment instructions are transported.</p>

<h3>Network Topology</h3>

<p>To make a payment, a participant needs to know what channels it can
send through.  Participants tell each other about channel and node
creation, and updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="07-routing-gossip.md">BOLT #7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery</a>
for details on the communication protocol, and <a href="10-dns-bootstrap.md">BOLT #10: DNS
Bootstrap and Assisted Node Location</a> for initial
network bootstrap.</p>

<h3>Payment Invoicing</h3>

<p>A participant receives invoices that tell her what payments to make.</p>

<p>See <a href="11-payment-encoding.md">BOLT #11: Invoice Protocol for Lightning Payments</a> for the protocol describing the destination and purpose of a payment such that the payer can later prove successful payment.</p>

<h2>Glossary and Terminology Guide</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Announcement</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A gossip message sent between <em>peers</em> intended to aid the discovery of a <em>channel</em> or a <em>node</em>.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><code>chain_hash</code>:</p>

<ul><li><p>The uniquely identifying hash of the target blockchain (usually the genesis hash).
This allows <em>nodes</em> to create and reference <em>channels</em> on
several blockchains. Nodes are to ignore any messages that reference a
<code>chain_hash</code> that are unknown to them. Unlike <code>bitcoin-cli</code>, the hash is
not reversed but is used directly.</p>

<p>For the main chain Bitcoin blockchain, the <code>chain_hash</code> value MUST be
(encoded in hex):
<code>6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000</code>.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Channel</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A fast, off-chain method of mutual exchange between two <em>peers</em>.
To transact funds, peers exchange signatures to create an updated <em>commitment transaction</em>.</li>
<li><em>See closure methods: mutual close, revoked transaction close, unilateral close</em></li>
<li><em>See related: route</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Closing transaction</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A transaction generated as part of a <em>mutual close</em>. A closing transaction is similar to a <em>commitment transaction</em>, but with no pending payments.</li>
<li><em>See related: commitment transaction, funding transaction, penalty transaction</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Commitment number</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A 48-bit incrementing counter for each <em>commitment transaction</em>; counters
are independent for each <em>peer</em> in the <em>channel</em> and start at 0.</li>
<li><em>See container: commitment transaction</em></li>
<li><em>See related: closing transaction, funding transaction, penalty transaction</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Commitment revocation private key</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Every <em>commitment transaction</em> has a unique commitment revocation private-key
value that allows the other <em>peer</em> to spend all outputs
immediately: revealing this key is how old commitment
transactions are revoked. To support revocation, each output of the
commitment transaction refers to the commitment revocation public key.</li>
<li><em>See container: commitment transaction</em></li>
<li><em>See originator: per-commitment secret</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Commitment transaction</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A transaction that spends the <em>funding transaction</em>.
Each <em>peer</em> holds the other peer's signature for this transaction, so that each
always has a commitment transaction that it can spend. After a new
commitment transaction is negotiated, the old one is <em>revoked</em>.</li>
<li><em>See parts: commitment number, commitment revocation private key, HTLC, per-commitment secret, outpoint</em></li>
<li><em>See related: closing transaction, funding transaction, penalty transaction</em></li>
<li><em>See types: revoked commitment transaction</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Final node</em>:</p>

<ul><li>The final recipient of a packet that is routing a payment from an <em>origin node</em> through some number of <em>hops</em>. It is also the final <em>receiving peer</em> in a chain.</li>
<li><em>See category: node</em></li>
<li><em>See related: origin node, processing node</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Funding transaction</em>:</p>

<ul><li>An irreversible on-chain transaction that pays to both <em>peers</em> on a <em>channel</em>.
It can only be spent by mutual consent.</li>
<li><em>See related: closing transaction, commitment transaction, penalty transaction</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Hop</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A <em>node</em>. Generally, an intermediate node lying between an <em>origin node</em> and a <em>final node</em>.</li>
<li><em>See category: node</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>HTLC</em>: Hashed Time Locked Contract.</p>

<ul><li>A conditional payment between two <em>peers</em>: the recipient can spend
the payment by presenting its signature and a <em>payment preimage</em>,
otherwise the payer can cancel the contract by spending it after
a given time. These are implemented as outputs from the
<em>commitment transaction</em>.</li>
<li><em>See container: commitment transaction</em></li>
<li><em>See parts: Payment hash, Payment preimage</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Invoice</em>: A request for funds on the Lightning Network, possibly
including payment type, payment amount, expiry, and other
information. This is how payments are made on the Lightning
Network, rather than using Bitcoin-style addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>It's ok to be odd</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A rule applied to some numeric fields that indicates either optional or
compulsory support for features. Even numbers indicate that both endpoints
MUST support the feature in question, while odd numbers indicate
that the feature MAY be disregarded by the other endpoint.</li></ul></li>

<li><em>See related: final node, processing node</em></li></ul></li>
<li><p><em>Outpoint</em>:</p>

<ul><li>A transaction hash and output index that uniquely identify an unspent transaction output. Needed to compose a new transaction, as an input.</li>

<li><p><em>Payment preimage</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Proof that payment has been received, held by
the final recipient, who is the only person who knows this
secret. The final recipient releases the preimage in order to
release funds. The payment preimage is hashed as the <em>payment hash</em>
in the <em>HTLC</em>.</li>

  (Go, go, go, go; go, go, go, go, go, go)


  [Chorus:]
  Oh released Lightning, it's better than a debit card..
  (Release Lightning, go release Lightning!)
  With released Lightning, micropayments just ain't hard...
  (Release Lightning, go release Lightning!)
  Then kaboom: we'll hit the moon -- release Lightning!
  (Go, go, go, go; go, go, go, go, go, go)


  We'll have QR codes, and smartphone apps, oh yeah.
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo)
  P2P messaging, and passive incomes, oh yeah.
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo)
  Outsourced closure watch, gives me feelings in my crotch.
  You'll know it's not a brag when the repo gets a tag:
  Released Lightning.

  [Instrumental, ~1m10s]
  [Chorus]
  (Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning!
   Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning!)


  C'mon guys, let's get to work!
