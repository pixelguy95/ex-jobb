# Week1

The first week on the project was relatively calm, I was sick for 2 days so I only got work done on Tuesday and Friday as well as a little extra over the weekend

The work I did this week can be summarized as following:

* Set up my work station at the Cinnober office
* Set up of my folder structure and github, gitignore etc...
* Wrote the first draft of my Master thesis plan with time diagram
* Set up my own bitcoin core node at home, which will be needed later.
* Started reading some of the whitepapers (did not finnish however)

This sums up the week pretty well.
