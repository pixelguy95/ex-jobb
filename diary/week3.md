# Week3

After a lot of struggle I finally got atomic swaps to work fully on the bitcoin side (both redeem and timelocked refund). I am considering moving it to a seperate repository later.

## Swap redeemed with secret

## Swap redeemed with timelocked refund

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was spent reading about lightning, more on swaps and segregated witness. As well as writing several pages on the report. A lot of what was writen has to be cleaned up and sources needs to be added. 

Next week I plan to finnish the atomic sawp by running a liteocin node and constructiong the appropriate transactions.
