# Week3

After a lot of struggle I finally got atomic swaps to work fully on the bitcoin side (both redeem and timelocked refund). I am considering moving it to a seperate repository later.

## Swap redeemed with secret

`821203b716d98a17f2a682fcfd8c6665e62eb03821c131839f035f8c2220a17f`
`0d945421466344f1fc693bd3795b745ce8ce0c80e56a735f27e94c050ee46120`

## Swap redeemed with timelocked refund

`6bb022a1c7b908af31f05dff39b05a2f3f58e6c418ce475368a58d2763945327`
`12fb72b46974ba0ddf297c891b2d0e9a9dd53a8542d08a62b100bf792ac40a25`

Tommorow (Wednesday) will be spent either completing the atomic swap on the litecoin side or writing a bit on the report.
