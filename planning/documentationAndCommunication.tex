\Section{Documentation and communication}
All the documentation and project diary will be collected into a single git-repo together with the thesis report. 

Communication with supervisors will be split between Oskar and Jan-Erik. When talking with Oskar the discussion will be more about technical and implementation wise. While communication with Jan-Erik will be mostly related to the report and other deadlines in the course.
