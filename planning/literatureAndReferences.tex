\Section{Literature and references}
This entire field is relatively new and quite complex, So a lot of extensive reading and studying has to be done. Below I have compiled the litterature and references I intend to look at primarily. This is only the start, more will probably be read as the project proceeds. 

\Subsection{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mastering bitcoin, second edition.\cite{antonopoulos_2017}
\item The original bitcoin whitepaper\cite{nakamoto2012bitcoin}
\item The original lightning network white paper\cite{poon_dryja_2016}
\end{itemize}

\Subsection{Source code}
A lot of the work will go into studying the source code and documentation for underlying technologies and solutions. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin}{Bitcoin core reference node}
	\item \href{https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd}{Lightning network node}
\end{itemize}

\Subsection{Other}
If the project gets stuck somewhere or something is unclear there is a number of places where I could get help from others who are involved in block-chain etc.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://bitcointalk.org/}{Bitcoin talk}
	\item \href{https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lnd}{Free node chat (lnd)}
\end{itemize}
