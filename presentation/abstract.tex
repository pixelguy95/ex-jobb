\chapter{Abstract}
To summerize the entire thesis I would say: ''I have experimented with, and studied the aspects of different types of atomic swaps. Wth the goal of formalizing a proposal on how they should be standardized and handled in the future.'' You probably do not know what an atomic swap is yet, but I will cover that.

The general topics covered are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cryptocurrencies and how they can be used in special use cases.
\item Cryptography
\item Smart/programmable contracts
\item Payment channels and lightning network
\end{itemize}

Don't worry if you do nt know anything about thee topics as I will cover them in this presentation.
