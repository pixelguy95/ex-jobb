\Section{Lightning network}
The payment channel I just described allows for unlimited transaction between two people.
It is quite usefull if you have two people who make a lot of transaction between each other,
but it would be very encumbersome to have a channel open to every person you might ever
make transactions to. This is where lightning network becomes useful. With just a few
additions to the payment channel it ill allow for transactions that travel through
multiple channels, safely of course.

To do this channels add another output to their commitment transactions that pay
to something called Hashed timelocked contract or HTLC for short. Just as before
I would like to cover the fine details of the contract, but there is no time for 
that. In simplest possible terms the contract says that each node along the way will
receive the money they put up plus a small fee if they can prove that the transaction
reached it's destination. This is done via hashes and pre-images, something I will touch
upon a bit later in this presentation.

The contract has a built in timelimit, if the transaction never makes it the whole way
to it's destination all transactions along the way will be refunded and nobody will receive
their fee. 

*Show basic image, talk about how large the network is*
