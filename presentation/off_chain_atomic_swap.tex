\Section{Off-chain atomic swaps}
How an on-chain atomic swap functions should be pretty clear. The script never does
anyhting I would call super complex. Off-chain atomic swaps however is a bit of
a different story and it can be pretty hard to grasp, escpecially with the
simplified explenations I have given so far. 

An off-chain atomic swap is as you might imagine an atomic swap, but if
it goes as planned it occurs entirrly without any script being executed
on the blockchain. In fact this version of an atomic swap does not use any
specialized scripts at all, instead it uses the clever mechanisms in htlc
contracts to perform it, even across chains. 

As you might remember from payment channels and lightning network 
a multi-hop transactions relies on the htlc contract to be safe. 
THe htlc contracts needs the same hashed pre-image and a strictly
decreasing timelock to be safe. This holds true even in the 
case where a multi-hop transaction travels across chains. 

THis is perhaps best demostrated with a diagram
