\Subsection{Implementation specifics}
So let's take a closer look at how I implemented this. To work with bitcoin and litecoin you
need a very specific setup. I had one Bitcoin node and one Litecoin node running on my raspberry pi 3
at home. Both running the latest version of their respective core implementations. The nodes were used 
for interacting with the blockchain (broadcasting, reading, monitoring etc...).
