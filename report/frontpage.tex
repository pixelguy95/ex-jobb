	While Bitcoin is beginning to cement it's core protocol and principles, the related technologies around it, such as atomic swaps and lightning network could still be considered to be in an infant state when it comes to understanding and development. In this thesis you will find atomic swaps being evaluated in depth, both off-chain and on-chain together with reasoned and somewhat well defined standards and protocols on how atomic swaps should be performed in the future.
