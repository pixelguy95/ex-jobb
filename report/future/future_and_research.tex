\chapter{Discussion \& Future research}
Overall I am happy with the work. The project started out with goals that were different than what it ended up being. What I am most unhappy about is that I realized so late into the project a much better goal, leading to a lot of time being wasted on experiments that were not particularly useful. 

If I could do the project over again my focus would have been more on actually developing the swapping plugin described in chapter 5. I feel personally that this would have been much more fulfilling, and it would have been a better demonstration of my actual proposal. As it is not the experiments and the proposal feels a bit disconnected, what I mean is that I could have reached the conclusion without performing most of the experiments. Even though my implementation was not entirely necessary I am still happy I did them, as there is very little information about atomic swaps especially the off-chain form. It was nice to get first hand experience with actual development using bitcoin tools and libraries, and experience with programmed contracts. 

I plan to at least give it a try to implement the plugin, but it will be during the coming summer and outside the scope of this thesis.
