\chapter{Implementation}
To implement the described types of atomic swaps, Go (golang) was used together with the standard libraries plus external libraries from the \textbf{btcsuite}: \textbf{btcsuite/btcd} and \textbf{btcsuite/btcutil}, as well as \textbf{lightningnetwork/lnd}, all of which can be found on github.com. The implementations are simplified, just like with this report the focus was on making it easy to understand for newcomers. 

To interact with the different blockchains two different full-nodes was setup. \textbf{Bitcoin Core 17.1} for bitcoin and \textbf{Litecoin Core  v0.16.3.0-82cacfef8}. Both running on their respective \textit{testnet}. Both nodes have a RPC interface to interact with the blockchain and the rest of the network. 

\Section{Onchain atomic swaps}
The implementation creates two simulated peers, called Alice and Bob
