\Section{Atomic swaps}
Another recent development in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is atomic swaps.
A regular swap can for example be two parties exchanging currencies. Before
this could be done in person, or via a trusted third-party handling all the
transactions. Atomic swaps however is as the name implies atomic. Meaning that
they either go through completely or no assets change hands at all, they are
also completely trust-less meaning that you don't have to trust neither the
other party or any third-party.

Just like lightning network atomic swaps use clever transaction scripts to
achieve new functionality. Atomic swaps have been shown to be possible over
lightning network, but it is mostly small projects and random writings on
forums etc

Atomic swaps was first described by Tier Nolan in a post on
\texttt{bitcointalk.org} on May 21, 2013.\cite{tier_nolan}
