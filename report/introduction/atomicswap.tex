Another recent development in bitcoin is atomic swaps. Atomic swaps was first described by Tier Nolan in a post on
\texttt{bitcointalk.org} on May 21, 2013.\cite{tier_nolan}
A regular swap can for example be two parties exchanging currencies. Before,
this could be done in person, or via a trusted third-party handling all the
transactions. Atomic swaps however is as the name implies atomic. Meaning that
they either go through completely or no assets change hands at all, they are
also completely trustless meaning that you don't have to trust the
other party or rely on any third-party

Just like lightning network atomic swaps use clever transaction scripts to
achieve new functionality. Atomic swaps have been shown to be possible in over
lightning network in theory. Yet today no standardized protocol exists, neither is it a part of the lightning network as it exists today.
