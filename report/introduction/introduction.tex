Although blockchain and other types of distributed ledgers are still in their
infancy a growing number of people and companies are starting to see that they
hold great promise, especially when it comes to financial technology, where
things like trust and security is held to be very important.

\Section{The goal of the project}
%The goal of the project is to evaluate all the methods of atomic swaps available
%and compare them to a couple of different scenarios and use cases. A secondary
%goal is to master payment channels, atomic swaps and the lightning network

The main goal of the project is to experiment and perform as many types of atomic swaps as time allows with the purpose of developing a proposal on how future implementations of atomic swaps could be standardized, in regards of protocol and software.

In regards to onchain atomic swaps, there is no protocol to update as it relies entirely on the largely unchanging logic of the bitcoin consensus protocol. Any proposed changes would be in regards to how existing wallet software could handle atomic swaps in the future if they ever become more mainstream.

Most lightning network node implementations follows aa standardization called the BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) AWFAFGFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
