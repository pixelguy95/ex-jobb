\chapter{Results \& Proposal}
In this section I will talk about the results I got when performing the types of atomic swaps detailed in previous chapters, and from these and my experience I will make a few proposals on how atomic swaps could  be standardized into clearly defined protocols and procedures.

\Section{Off-chain atomic swaps}
How off-chain atomic swaps are performed are a bit harder to understand and required a lot more work, and yet in my opinion they hold more potential for the future. The limitation that comes with having more than one node running still exists, but the cost that comes with broadcasting transactions on-chain is almost completely removed. 

In my experiments I did open a proper channel and performed an atomic swap. I did not however do it over the real lightning  network.
